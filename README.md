This is a course project for Computational Creativity 2020.

The system generates jazz tunes by first generating chord sequences, and then using the chord tones, bass and melody arpeggios on top.
The chord sequences are generated using markov chains, the outputs of which are scored using a LSTM language model. Both are trained using (insert dataset name here).

Installation:
1. Clone the repo
2. Clone pychord (insert link here), replace the file (insert filename) with (insert filename).
3. Run an enjoy. We recommend using a DAW to play the midi files with instruments of choice. Audio rendering is on its way.
